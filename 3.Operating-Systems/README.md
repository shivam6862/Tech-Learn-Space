## Process Scheduling Algorithms (Preemption Vs Non-Preemption) | CPU Scheduling in OS

## What is Arrival, Burst, Completion, Turnaround, Waiting and Response time in CPU Scheduling

1. First Come First Serve(FCFS) CPU Scheduling Algorithm

2. Shortest Job First(SJF) Scheduling Algorithm

3. Shortest Remaining Time First (SJF With Preemption) Scheduling Algorithm

   - NOTE :- Preemption WORD

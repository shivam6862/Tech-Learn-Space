# Computer Architecture

Computer architecture covers the design and organization of computer systems. Topics include CPU design, instruction set architecture, memory hierarchy, and input/output systems.

### Von Neumann's Architecture | Stored Memory Concept:

- **Von Neumann's Architecture:**

  - Named after John von Neumann, it is a computer architecture that uses the same memory space for data and instructions. The CPU fetches instructions from memory and processes them sequentially.

- **Stored Memory Concept:**
  - The idea that both data and instructions are stored in the same memory, and the CPU fetches instructions from memory for execution.

### Various General Purpose Registers:

- **General Purpose Registers:**
  - Registers within the CPU that can be used for various purposes, such as storing data temporarily during computation.

### Types of Buses (Address, Data, and Control):

- **Address Bus:**

  - Carries memory addresses from the CPU to memory or I/O devices.

- **Data Bus:**

  - Transfers data between the CPU, memory, and I/O devices.

- **Control Bus:**
  - Carries control signals that coordinate and manage the activities of various components in the system.

### Common Bus System using Multiplexer:

- **Common Bus System:**

  - A system where multiple components share a common bus for communication.

- **Multiplexer:**
  - A device that selects one of many input signals and directs it to a single output.

### Common Bus System | How Basic Computer Works:

- **Common Bus System (Recap):**

  - Components communicate using a shared bus for transferring data and control signals.

- **How Basic Computer Works:**
  - Fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, performs operations, and stores resultsâ€”all facilitated by the common bus.

### Types of Instructions in General Purpose Computer:

### What is Addressing Mode | Various Types of Addressing Modes:

- **Addressing Mode:**
  - Specifies how an operand is designated, determining how the operand's address is calculated.

1. **Implied Addressing Mode:**

   - The operand is implicit in the operation, requiring no additional specification.

2. **Immediate Addressing Mode:**

   - The operand is directly specified within the instruction.

3. **Register Mode | Addressing Mode:**

   - The operand is a register.

4. **Register Indirect Mode | Addressing Modes:**

   - The content of a register is used as an address to access data.

5. **Auto Increment and Decrement Addressing Modes:**

   - The address in a register is automatically incremented or decremented after accessing data.

6. **Direct Addressing Mode:**

   - The operand's address is explicitly given in the instruction.

7. **Indirect Addressing Mode:**

   - The operand's address is located in a register or memory location.

8. **Relative Addressing Mode:**

   - The operand's address is specified as a displacement from the current program counter or instruction.

9. **Base Register Addressing Mode:**

   - Uses a base register value to calculate the operand's address.

10. **Indexed Addressing Mode:**

### Independent vs. Hierarchical Memory Organization | 2-Level Memory Organization:

- **Independent Memory Organization:**

  - Each level of memory operates independently.

- **Hierarchical Memory Organization:**

  - Memory levels are organized in a hierarchy, with each level acting as a cache for the level below it.

- **2-Level Memory Organization:**
  - A memory system with two levels, typically involving a faster, smaller, and more expensive level (e.g., cache) and a slower, larger, and less expensive level (e.g., main memory).

### 3-Level Memory Organization:

- A memory system with three levels, typically involving cache, main memory, and secondary storage.

### Cache Mapping || Cache Mapping Techniques:

- **Cache Mapping:**

  - The process of determining where to place blocks in the cache.

- **Cache Mapping Techniques:**

  1. **Direct Mapping:**
     - Each block of main memory maps to exactly one block in the cache.
  2. **Fully Associative Mapping:**
     - Any block of main memory can map to any block in the cache.
  3. **Set Associative Mapping:**
     - A compromise between direct and fully associative, where each set has multiple blocks, and a block from main memory can map to any block within the set.

- **Advantages and Disadvantages of Direct Mapping:**
  - **Advantages:** Simple and fast.
  - **Disadvantages:** Limited flexibility, potential for conflicts.

### Locality of Reference in Cache Memory | Spatial Vs. Temporal Locality:

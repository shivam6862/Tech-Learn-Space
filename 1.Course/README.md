# Computer Science Fundamentals

## 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

**Description:**
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that utilizes objects, instances of classes, to organize and design code. Key concepts include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

**Examples:**
Java, C++, Python

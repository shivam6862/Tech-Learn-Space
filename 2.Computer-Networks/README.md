# Computer-Networks

## Introduction to Computer Network

Computer networks involve the interconnection of computers for resource and information sharing. Topics include network protocols, communication models, network security, and data transmission.

## OSI stands

OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection. The OSI model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a communication or networking system into seven abstraction layers. Each layer serves a specific purpose and interacts with the adjacent layers to facilitate communication between devices on a network. The OSI model is not a physical model but a conceptual one, helping in understanding and designing network architectures.

## LAN, MAN, WAN, PAN , CAN

These terms refer to different types of networks based on their geographical scope and purpose. Here's what each acronym stands for:

1. **PAN (Personal Area Network):**

   - Definition: A network for personal devices within the range of an individual person, typically within about 10 meters.
   - Purpose: PANs are commonly used for connecting devices like smartphones, laptops, tablets, and wearable devices. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are often used for PAN communication.

2. **LAN (Local Area Network):**

   - Definition: A network that is limited to a small geographic area, such as a single building or a campus.
   - Purpose: LANs are typically used for connecting computers and devices within a close proximity, allowing them to share resources like files, printers, and internet connections.

3. **CAN (Controller Area Network):**

   - Definition: A network used in vehicles and industrial applications for communication between microcontrollers and devices without a host computer.
   - Purpose: CAN is commonly used in automotive applications for communication between various components in a vehicle, such as engine control units, sensors, and actuators.

4. **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):**

   - Definition: A network that covers a larger geographic area than a LAN but is still confined to a city or a large campus.
   - Purpose: MANs connect multiple LANs within a city or metropolitan area, providing high-speed connectivity over a larger geographical area than a LAN.

5. **WAN (Wide Area Network):**

   - Definition: A network that spans a large geographic area, often a country or even multiple countries.
   - Purpose: WANs connect multiple LANs and MANs over long distances, allowing for the transmission of data and communication between widely distributed locations. The internet itself can be considered a global WAN.

## TCP/IP Protocol Suite | Internet Protocol Suite | OSI vs TCP/IP

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model and the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) suite are two conceptual frameworks that define the functions of a communication system, but they have some differences.

### OSI Model:

1. **Layers:**

   - The OSI model consists of seven layers, each responsible for specific functions. These layers, from the bottom to the top, are: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

2. **Development:**

   - The OSI model was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to provide a comprehensive and universally applicable framework for network communication.

3. **Flexibility:**

   - It offers a more flexible and general approach to networking, allowing for a broader understanding of network architecture.

4. **Notable Mention:**
   - The OSI model is often used for educational purposes and as a reference model, but it is not as widely implemented in practice as the TCP/IP suite.

### TCP/IP Suite:

1. **Layers:**

   - The TCP/IP model, also known as the Internet Protocol Suite, consists of four layers: Link, Internet, Transport, and Application. These correspond loosely to the lower layers of the OSI model.

2. **Development:**

   - The TCP/IP suite was developed by the U.S. Department of Defense and has become the foundation for the Internet. It is the de facto standard for networking.

3. **Practical Implementation:**

   - TCP/IP is more commonly implemented in real-world networking scenarios, especially on the Internet. The protocols within the TCP/IP suite, such as TCP and IP, are widely used for communication between devices.

4. **Simplicity:**
   - The TCP/IP suite is often considered simpler than the OSI model, and its implementation has been very successful, particularly in the context of the global Internet.

### Comparison:

- The OSI model is more of a theoretical or conceptual model, whereas the TCP/IP suite is a practical and widely implemented set of protocols.

- The OSI model has seven layers, while the TCP/IP model has four layers. The functionalities of the layers in the TCP/IP model are somewhat merged compared to the distinct layers in the OSI model.

   - A logical '1' is represented by a low-to-high transition.

3. **Characteristics:**

   - The bit period is divided into two halves.
   - Each bit has a transition at its midpoint, making it easy to synchronize and detect.

4. **Advantages:**

   - Provides clock synchronization due to transitions at the middle of each bit.
   - Well-suited for environments with varying signal levels.

5. **Disadvantages:**
   - Requires twice the bandwidth compared to non-return-to-zero encoding.
   - May be less efficient in terms of bandwidth utilization.

### Differential Manchester Encoding:

   - In differential Manchester encoding, transitions at the middle of the bit period are used for synchronization.
   - The actual bit value is determined by the presence or absence of a transition at the beginning of the bit period.

2. **Representation:**

   - A logical '0' is represented by a transition at the beginning if the previous bit was a '1' and no transition if the previous bit was a '0'.
   - A logical '1' is represented by the absence of a transition at the beginning if the previous bit was a '1' and a transition if the previous bit was a '0'.

3. **Characteristics:**

   - It also uses transitions at the middle of each bit for synchronization.
   - No transition at the beginning indicates the same bit value, while a transition indicates a change.

4. **Advantages:**

   - Clock synchronization is maintained.

5. **Disadvantages:**
   - Still requires twice the bandwidth compared to non-return-to-zero encoding.
   - Complexity in decoding compared to standard Manchester encoding.

### Summary:

- Both Manchester and differential Manchester encoding ensure synchronization by having transitions in the middle of each bit period.
- Manchester encoding directly represents the data using transitions, while differential Manchester encoding determines the data based on transitions at the beginning of each bit period.
- Both encoding schemes are used in different applications, and the choice depends on factors like bandwidth requirements, noise immunity, and synchronization needs.

## Repeaters in Computer Networks | Physical layer devices

A repeater is a network device that operates at the Physical Layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model. Its primary function is to regenerate and amplify signals as they traverse a network medium, allowing data to travel longer distances without signal degradation. Repeaters play a crucial role in extending the reach of a network, especially in the context of wired communication.

### Key Characteristics and Functions of Repeaters:

1. **Signal Regeneration:**

   - **Function:** A repeater receives a signal, cleans it of noise and distortion, and then retransmits the regenerated signal. This process helps overcome signal degradation over long cable runs.

2. **Amplification:**

   - **Function:** Repeaters amplify the signal to compensate for the loss of signal strength that occurs as the signal travels through a medium, such as a coaxial cable or fiber optic cable.

3. **Distance Extension:**

   - **Function:** By cleaning and amplifying signals, repeaters extend the effective distance over which data can be transmitted without significant loss of quality.

4. **Interconnect Network Segments:**

   - **Function:** Repeaters are often used to connect different segments of a network, enabling communication between distant parts of the network.

5. **Transparent Operation:**

   - **Characteristics:** Repeaters operate transparently to the network and higher-layer protocols. They don't interpret or modify data at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) or higher layers.

6. **Simple Design:**

   - **Characteristics:** Repeaters are relatively simple devices with minimal intelligence. They focus on amplifying and regenerating signals without any protocol-specific processing.

7. **Application in Various Network Types:**
   - **Characteristics:** Repeaters can be used in various network types, including Ethernet networks (e.g., 10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX), fiber optic networks, and other point-to-point or point-to-multipoint configurations.

### Considerations and Limitations:

1. **Propagation Delay:**

   - While repeaters extend the range of a network, they introduce some propagation delay as the signal passes through them.

2. **Limited to Physical Layer:**

   - Repeaters operate solely at the Physical Layer and do not participate in the logical functions of higher layers.

3. **Suitability for Analog Signals:**

   - Repeaters are more commonly associated with analog signals but can also be used in digital networks to extend the reach of signals.

4. **Use in Fiber Optic Networks:**
   - In fiber optic networks, repeaters are often referred to as "optical amplifiers" and are used to boost signals in long-distance transmission.

Repeaters are essential for maintaining signal integrity and extending the reach of a network, particularly in scenarios where long-distance communication is required. However, as technology has advanced, other devices like switches and routers have become more prevalent in modern network architectures. These devices offer additional functionality beyond signal regeneration and amplification, such as filtering, addressing, and traffic management.

## Hub in Computer Networks | Physical layer devices

A hub is a network device that operates at the Physical Layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model. Its primary function is to connect multiple devices in a local area network (LAN) and facilitate the transmission of data between them. Hubs are simple and operate as multi-port repeaters, broadcasting incoming data to all connected devices without distinguishing the intended recipient. Hubs were more commonly used in early Ethernet networks but have largely been replaced by more intelligent devices like switches.

### Key Characteristics and Functions of Hubs:

1. **Multi-Port Connectivity:**

   - **Function:** Hubs typically have multiple ports, allowing several devices to connect to the same network segment.

2. **Signal Regeneration:**

   - **Function:** Like a repeater, a hub regenerates and amplifies incoming signals before broadcasting them to all connected devices.

3. **Broadcast Transmission:**

   - **Function:** Hubs operate in a broadcast mode, meaning that when one device sends data, the hub broadcasts that data to all other connected devices.

4. **Collision Domain:**

   - **Characteristics:** All devices connected to a hub share the same collision domain. This means that if two devices transmit data simultaneously, a collision may occur, leading to data corruption.

5. **No Filtering:**

   - **Characteristics:** Hubs do not filter or analyze data at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) or higher layers. They operate purely at the Physical Layer.

6. **Simple Design:**

   - **Characteristics:** Hubs are relatively simple devices with minimal intelligence. They do not make decisions based on MAC addresses or have the ability to selectively forward data to specific ports.

7. **Half-Duplex Communication:**
   - **Characteristics:** Hubs typically operate in half-duplex mode, meaning that devices connected to the hub can either send or receive data at any given time, but not both simultaneously.

### Considerations and Limitations:

1. **Collision Issues:**

   - In a hub environment, collisions can occur when two devices attempt to transmit data simultaneously. This can lead to performance degradation.

2. **Bandwidth Sharing:**

   - Bandwidth is shared among all connected devices. As more devices are added, the available bandwidth per device decreases.

3. **Limited Intelligence:**

   - Hubs lack the intelligence found in more advanced devices like switches. They do not have the ability to learn MAC addresses or make forwarding decisions based on destination addresses.

4. **Not Suitable for Modern Networks:**
   - Due to their limitations, hubs are not suitable for modern high-performance networks. Switches are commonly used instead.

While hubs were once a common networking device, they have largely been phased out in favor of switches. Switches offer more intelligent and efficient data transmission by making forwarding decisions based on MAC addresses, reducing collisions, and providing full-duplex communication. Hubs are considered legacy technology and are not recommended for use in modern networks.

## Bridges In Computer Networks | Physical and data link layer device

A bridge is a network device that operates at both the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) and sometimes the Physical Layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model. Its primary function is to connect and filter traffic between two or more network segments, making decisions based on the hardware addresses (MAC addresses) of devices within the network. Bridges are used to divide a large network into smaller segments, reducing collision domains and improving overall network performance.

### Key Characteristics and Functions of Bridges:

{make spanning tree}

1. **Segmentation:**

   - **Function:** Bridges divide a larger network into smaller segments or collision domains. Each segment operates independently, reducing the likelihood of collisions.

2. **Filtering:**

   - **Function:** Bridges filter traffic based on MAC addresses. They make forwarding decisions to either allow or block the passage of data frames between segments.

3. **Learning MAC Addresses:**

   - **Function:** Bridges dynamically learn the MAC addresses of devices connected to each segment by examining the source addresses of incoming frames.

4. **Forwarding Decisions:**

   - **Function:** Once a bridge has learned the MAC addresses of devices on its connected segments, it can make intelligent forwarding decisions, sending frames only to the segment where the destination device resides.

5. **Collision Domain Isolation:**

   - **Characteristics:** Bridges create separate collision domains for each segment, improving overall network performance by reducing collisions.

6. **Operates at Data Link Layer:**

   - **Characteristics:** Bridges primarily function at the Data Link Layer, making decisions based on MAC addresses found in the data link header of Ethernet frames.

7. **Transparent Operation:**

   - **Characteristics:** Bridges operate transparently to higher-layer protocols. They do not interpret or modify data at the network or transport layers.

8. **Limited to Similar Network Types:**

   - **Characteristics:** Traditional bridges are designed to connect segments using the same network protocol, such as Ethernet.

9. **Can Connect Different Media Types:**
   - **Characteristics:** Some modern bridges support connecting segments with different physical media types, such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi.

### Considerations and Limitations:

1. **Broadcast Traffic:**

   - While bridges can reduce the propagation of broadcast traffic between segments, some broadcast traffic is still forwarded.

2. **Limited to Two Collision Domains:**

   - Traditional bridges connect two network segments and isolate them into separate collision domains. More advanced devices like switches can connect multiple segments.

3. **Scalability:**

   - For larger networks, switches are often preferred over traditional bridges as they provide greater scalability and performance.

4. **Transition to Switches:**
   - As network technology has evolved, bridges have largely been replaced by more intelligent devices like switches, which offer better performance, more ports, and additional features.

Bridges played a crucial role in early network designs, especially when Ethernet was the dominant LAN technology. While traditional bridges are less common today, the concept has evolved into more advanced devices like switches, which provide similar functions along with additional features to meet the demands of modern networks.

  - They operate in full-duplex mode, allowing simultaneous data transmission and reception.
  - Switches significantly reduce collision domains, improving overall network performance.
  - Modern switches often support additional features like VLANs, Quality of Service (QoS), and more.
- **Advantages:**
  - High performance, efficient data forwarding, and low collision likelihood.
  - Better suited for modern networks compared to hubs and traditional bridges.

### Summary:

- Hubs are basic devices that operate at the Physical Layer and broadcast data to all connected devices.
- Bridges are more intelligent devices that operate at both the Physical and Data Link layers, dividing a network into smaller segments.
- Switches are advanced devices that operate primarily at the Data Link Layer, making efficient forwarding decisions based on MAC addresses and offering high-performance data switching.

In modern networks, switches have largely replaced hubs and traditional bridges due to their advanced features and superior performance.

## Routers in Computer Networks | Physical, data link and network layer device

A router is a network device that operates at multiple layers of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, specifically the Network Layer (Layer 3) and often the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) and Physical Layer (Layer 1). Routers are essential for connecting different networks, determining the best path for data transmission, and directing traffic between devices. Here's an overview of the characteristics and functions of routers:

### Key Characteristics and Functions of Routers:

1. **Network Layer Operation (Layer 3):**

   - **Function:** Routers primarily operate at the Network Layer, making forwarding decisions based on logical addressing (IP addresses).
   - **Characteristics:**
     - Routers use routing tables to determine the optimal path for data packets to reach their destination.
     - They are protocol-aware and can work with various network layer protocols, such as IPv4 and IPv6.

2. **Data Link Layer Operation (Layer 2):**

   - **Function:** Routers often have interfaces at the Data Link Layer to connect to local networks directly.
   - **Characteristics:**
     - Ethernet is a common data link layer protocol used by routers for communication within a local network.

3. **Physical Layer Connectivity (Layer 1):**

   - **Function:** Routers connect different physical network segments.
   - **Characteristics:**
     - Routers have physical interfaces for various network media, such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or serial connections, depending on the network's requirements.

4. **Packet Forwarding:**

   - **Function:** Routers examine the destination IP address in each packet and forward the packet to the next hop on the route to the destination.
   - **Characteristics:**
     - Routers maintain routing tables that contain information about network addresses and the corresponding next-hop routers.

5. **Interconnecting Networks:**

   - **Function:** Routers connect different networks, such as local area networks (LANs) or wide area networks (WANs), facilitating communication between devices on different networks.
   - **Characteristics:**
     - Routers play a crucial role in internetworking and the exchange of data between distinct network segments.

6. **Network Address Translation (NAT):**

   - **Function:** Routers can perform NAT, translating private IP addresses used within a local network to a single public IP address for communication on the internet.
   - **Characteristics:**
     - NAT helps conserve public IP addresses and enhances network security.

7. **Security and Filtering:**

   - **Function:** Routers can implement security features, such as access control lists (ACLs) and firewalls, to control the flow of traffic and enhance network security.
   - **Characteristics:**
     - ACLs can filter traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and other criteria.

8. **Dynamic Routing Protocols:**
   - **Function:** Routers can use dynamic routing protocols to exchange routing information with other routers and adapt to changes in network topology.
   - **Characteristics:**
     - Examples of dynamic routing protocols include OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and RIP (Routing Information Protocol).

### Considerations and Limitations:

1. **Processing Overhead:**

   - Routers may introduce some processing overhead due to the complexity of examining and forwarding packets based on logical addressing.

2. **Configuration and Maintenance:**

   - Proper configuration and maintenance of routing tables are essential for optimal router performance and network connectivity.

3. **Layer 3 and Layer 2 Interactions:**

   - Routers must interact effectively with both Layer 3 and Layer 2 protocols to facilitate end-to-end communication.

4. **Scalability:**
   - Routers are scalable and can be used in large and complex networks, but their performance may depend on factors like processing power and available memory.

Routers play a critical role in the functioning of the internet and complex enterprise networks, directing traffic between different networks and ensuring the efficient and secure exchange of data. They are integral components of the modern networking infrastructure.
